Hello, I am Rowena, a final-year bachelor's student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, majoring in **Artificial Intelligence and Information Engineering** with a minor in **Applied Mathematics**.

I'm a highly motivated and intellectually curious individual with a strong passion for projects and research in technology and engineering. During my studies, I've actively engaged in various international internships and academic exchange programs, which have broadened my global perspective and provided invaluable practical experience. These include attending the **Cambridge University Summer Programme** in the UK, participating in the **Hanyang University Winter School** in South Korea, and undertaking an exchange semester in **Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology** in Sweden. I also had the privilege of interning at the **Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, and the **University of Toronto** in Canada.

Beyond my academic and industrial pursuits, I've been awarded over ten scholarships, notably the **Hong Kong Government Scholarship** and the **PolyU Presidential Student Leadership Award**, which acknowledge my dedication and achievements.

My interests extend beyond academia. I'm an avid and organized traveler, having undertaken solo trips to over ten countries to immerse myself in diverse cultures and and landscapes. My guiding principle is captured by the phrase, "**博学而笃志**" (to be learned in many things and to be firm in one's aspirations), reflecting my insatiable desire for knowledge and my commitment to continuous exploration and understanding. I maintain a profound curiosity about all facets of knowledge.

Should you find my profile of interest or wish to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to contact me.
